        <h3>Dingo</h3>

        <p>
            Research shows that dingo is an Australia&apos;s wild dog and they could be descendants of Asian dingoes that appeared 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. 
            These omnivores may live either alone (especially young males) or in packs of up to ten animals. 
            Their main food source varies from rabbits, birds, lizards to fruits and plants. 
            They breed merely once a year and each delivery usually have five pups, which will stay with their parents until six to eight months of age.

        &quot;In packs, a dominant breeding female <span class="highlight">will kill</span> the offspring of other females.&quot;

        <h3>Kangaroo</h3>
        <img class="two" src="/assets/Kangaroo.jpg" alt="Kangaroo" width="400" height="300">
        <p class="a">
            Kangaroo is a member of the Macropodidae family, meaning big foot in Latin, which obviously refers to the species' unsually large feet. 
            They have short hair, powerful hind legs, small forelimbs and a long tail. Especially, their eyesight and hearing are extremely good.

        <h3>Koala bear</h3>
        <img class="three" src="/assets/Koala.jpg" alt="Koala" width="400" height="300">
        <p>
            This iconic Australian animal is a tree-climbing one and a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring. 
            Some highlights of their appearance are having two opposing thumbs on their hands, both feet and hands have rough pads and claws and two toes, fused together.

        <h3>Kookaburra</h3>
        <img class="four" src="/assets/Kookaburra.jpg" alt="Kookaburra" width="400" height="300">
        <p>
            An Australian bird featuring the dawn chorus. 
            The reason behind its feature is because of its laugh-like voice.
             About its physical identification, it is generally off-white below, faintly barred with dark brown on the back and wings. 
             Its face has a conspicuous dark brown eye-stripe, and its tail is more rufous and broadly barred with black.
